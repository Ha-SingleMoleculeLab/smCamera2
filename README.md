This is a Windows program that combines smFRET data acquisition and analysis in one GUI program. 
smCamera2 package.zip is what you need to install the program.
The source code is in smCamera2_source.zip. You need to put LKSLib (after unzipping it) in the same folder as the source code folder to compile using Visual C++.
